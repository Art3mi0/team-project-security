## User Roles
### User
We anticipate our app will function the same for each user with all features being available. This user can range from anyone who is interested in security to a cybersecurity analyst.

## Building the Project
In android studio, from file, make a new project from version control. If not signed in to git, do so now through the interface. The easiest way would be to generate a token (you would sign in to git in a web browser, and android studio would automatically choose the right permissions to grant it). Once signed in, you should see the project. After choosing it and cloning it, head back to file, open, and open the android studio project. What was cloned was the entire git project, so to work on the android studio specific project, you must open it. Once everything finishes loading/downloading, at the top right, there should be an elephant looking icon, "sync project with gradle files", click that, and give your project several minutes to build. Progress can be viewed at the bottom right of the screen. Everything should be ready to work after that. 

*PLEASE REMEMBER GIT WORKFLOW*
* Pull/update project
* After completing something, regardless of size, commit
* After you felt you've done a lot, or have finished, pull/update once more, resolve conflicts, and finally commit and push your work

## Running Tests
* In android studio, pull down on the menu where the build to be run is selected.
* Name this run configuration "All Tests"
* From here, ensure the module is set to Security_App.app
* Set test to "All in Module".
* Click OK.
* Now that the run configurations have been set up, simply select the "All Tests" configuration and click run.
